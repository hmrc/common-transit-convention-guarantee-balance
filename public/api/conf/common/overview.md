Use the CTC Guarantee Balance API to provide traders with up-to-date information about how much of their guarantee funds they have left to use when organising transit movements.

The API endpoints relate only to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

You can also use the HMRC sandbox environment to run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland transit movements.

**Version 1.0 of the API supports only NCTS phase 4. Version 2.0 of the API supports only NCTS phase 5.**

For a detailed overview of v1.0 of the API, see [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 4 service guide](/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-service-guide/). For a detailed overview of v2.0 of the API, see [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 5 service guide](/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-phase5-service-guide/).
